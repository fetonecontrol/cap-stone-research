## This is the plan.

# The rubber ducky method

## MVP

* log user input (either speech to text or just text(speech to text preferable. Speaking outloud helps one hear themselves)
* utilize speech to text API to translate user input.
* utilize sentiment analisys API to interpret user input.
* look for keywords associated with user input, log frequency in relation to pos/neg/neutral decoding.
* provide %percent pos/neg/neutral interperitation of user input, per experience.
* modify dom with cool colors and effects relevant to user input.


## Sandbox 

_Put Random Ideas here_
* might pivot from general experiences to something that helps plan things or workout problems for people.
* describe the problem.
* describe what you know.
* descreibe what you don't know.
* describe what you might not not know you know.
* Query respective DB's with structured search terms from user input
* Decide on MVP of speech to text, and either analize either the speech, the text, or both, and store the information.


## To-Do-List 9.25.20

* research viable API's for sentinment tracking per experience.
* create front end wireframe of product.
* create component diagram.
* decide on cloud hosting for DB, or scaffold C# MySql DB.
